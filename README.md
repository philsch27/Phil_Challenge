# Philip_Challenge
Comcast - DevOps Engineer - SED challenge

This repository includes an ansible playbook that deploys nginx to a remote host, configures the nginx default config file, index.html file, and configure required iptables rules.

The following tasks have been completed:

• Secure this application and host such that only appropriate ports are publicly exposed and
any http requests are redirected to https. This should be automated using a configuration
management tool of your choice and you should feel free to use a self-signed certificate for
the web server.

• Express everything in code.

• Provide your code in a Git repository named <FIRSTNAME>_Challenge on GitHub.com
  
The following item is not included, but will be added in the future:
  
• Develop and apply automated tests to validate the correctness of the server configuration.
